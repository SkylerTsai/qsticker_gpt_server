(   )24　片餅乾，平分給　6　個人和平分給　8　個人，哪一種分法每個人所拿到的餅乾比較多？　(Ａ)平分給　6　個人　(Ｂ)平分給　8　個人　(Ｃ)一樣多。,答案：(Ａ) 解析：24－6＝18，18－6＝12，12－6＝6，6－6＝0（或用乘法算式記錄），表示平分給　6　個人，一個人拿到　4　片。 24－8＝16，16－8＝8，8－8＝0（或用乘法算式記錄），表示平分給　8　個人，一個人拿到　3　片。 4＞3，所以平分給　6　個人，每個人拿到的比較多。 ,易,9-2_平分,"- **ANSWER:** (Ａ)平分給　6　個人 - **SOLUTION:**   - Calculate the number of cookies each person gets when 24 cookies are divided among 6 people: $$ \frac{24}{6} = 4 $$   - Calculate the number of cookies each person gets when 24 cookies are divided among 8 people: $$ \frac{24}{8} = 3 $$   - Since 4 cookies per person (when divided among 6 people) is more than 3 cookies per person (when divided among 8 people), the answer is (Ａ)平分給　6　個人.",1484,0.009760000000000001,51.94824504852295,True,GRADE: CORRECT  The student's answer correctly identifies that each person gets more cookies when 24 cookies are divided among 6 people compared to when they are divided among 8 people. The calculations provided are accurate and align with the context.,True,"EXPLANATION: 1. The question asks which method of dividing 24 cookies results in each person getting more cookies: dividing among 6 people or dividing among 8 people. 2. The context provides the correct answer and the reasoning behind it:    - When 24 cookies are divided among 6 people, each person gets 4 cookies.    - When 24 cookies are divided among 8 people, each person gets 3 cookies.    - Since 4 cookies per person is more than 3 cookies per person, the correct answer is (Ａ)平分給　6　個人. 3. The student's answer is:    - **ANSWER:** (Ａ)平分給　6　個人    - **SOLUTION:**       - Calculate the number of cookies each person gets when 24 cookies are divided among 6 people: \( \frac{24}{6} = 4 \)      - Calculate the number of cookies each person gets when 24 cookies are divided among 8 people: \( \frac{24}{8} = 3 \)      - Since 4 cookies per person (when divided among 6 people) is more than 3 cookies per person (when divided among 8 people), the answer is (Ａ)平分給　6　個人. 4. The student's answer matches the correct answer provided in the context. 5. The student's solution correctly calculates the number of cookies each person gets in both scenarios and correctly concludes that dividing among 6 people results in more cookies per person.
