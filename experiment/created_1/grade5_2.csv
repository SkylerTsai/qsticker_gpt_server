(   )0.7×0.49＝　(Ａ)　7　(Ｂ)　0.7　(Ｃ)　0.343　(Ｄ)　0.0343。,"- **ANSWER**: (Ｃ) 0.343 - **SOLUTION**:   - To solve the question, we need to multiply 0.7 by 0.49.   - The calculation is: $$0.7 \times 0.49 = 0.343$$   - Therefore, the correct answer is (Ｃ) 0.343.",問題: (   )0.8×0.65＝　(Ａ)　5.2　(Ｂ)　0.52　(Ｃ)　0.52　(Ｄ)　0.052。,- **ANSWER:** (Ｂ) 0.52 - **SOLUTION:**   1. Multiply the two numbers: $0.8 \times 0.65$   2. Perform the multiplication: $0.8 \times 0.65 = 0.52$   3. The correct answer is (Ｂ) 0.52,14.661141157150269,1,True,QUESTION: 問題: (   )0.8×0.65＝　(Ａ)　5.2　(Ｂ)　0.52　(Ｃ)　0.52　(Ｄ)　0.052。 ANSWER AND SOLUTION:  - **ANSWER:** (Ｂ) 0.52  - **SOLUTION:**    1. Multiply the two numbers: $0.8 \times 0.65$    2. Perform the multiplication: $0.8 \times 0.65 = 0.52$    3. The correct answer is (Ｂ) 0.52 EXPLANATION: The student correctly identified the multiplication of 0.8 and 0.65 as 0.52. The answer provided is rational and matches the correct multiplication result. RATIONALITY: CORRECT,True,"EXPLANATION: 1. The question asks to find the product of 0.8 and 0.65 and choose the correct answer from the given options. 2. The student begins by identifying the operation required: multiplication of 0.8 and 0.65. 3. The student performs the multiplication: $0.8 \times 0.65$. 4. The student states that the result of the multiplication is 0.52. 5. The student then selects option (Ｂ) 0.52 as the correct answer.  To verify the student's solution: - We need to check if the multiplication $0.8 \times 0.65$ indeed equals 0.52. - Multiplying 0.8 by 0.65:   - $0.8 \times 0.65 = 0.52$ (This is correct).  Since the student's steps are logically sound and the multiplication is performed correctly, the student's answer is correct.  GRADE: CORRECT",2491,0.018495
