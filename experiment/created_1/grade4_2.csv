(   )媽媽到水果店買水果，下列哪一種水果的體積最大？　(Ａ)一顆草莓　(Ｂ)一顆柳丁　(Ｃ)一顆檸檬　(Ｄ)一顆西瓜。,"### ANSWER: - (D) 一顆西瓜  ### SOLUTION: - To determine which fruit has the largest volume, we need to compare the average volumes of a strawberry, an orange, a lemon, and a watermelon. - **Strawberry**: The average volume of a strawberry is relatively small, typically around 12 cm³. - **Orange**: The average volume of an orange is larger than a strawberry, typically around 250 cm³. - **Lemon**: The average volume of a lemon is similar to that of an orange, typically around 200 cm³. - **Watermelon**: The average volume of a watermelon is significantly larger than the other fruits, typically around 20,000 cm³.  - By comparing these volumes, it is clear that the watermelon has the largest volume among the listed fruits. Therefore, the answer is (D) 一顆西瓜.",問題: (   )小明到玩具店買玩具，下列哪一種玩具的體積最大？　(Ａ)一個彈珠　(Ｂ)一個積木　(Ｃ)一個籃球　(Ｄ)一個玩具火車。,"### ANSWER: - (Ｃ) 一個籃球  ### SOLUTION: - To determine which toy has the largest volume, we need to compare the typical volumes of each toy:   - **彈珠 (Marble)**: A marble is a small spherical object. The volume of a sphere is given by the formula $V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$. For a typical marble with a radius of about 1 cm, the volume is approximately $4.19 \, \text{cm}^3$.   - **積木 (Building Block)**: A building block can vary in size, but a common size might be a cube with a side length of 5 cm. The volume of a cube is $V = s^3$, so the volume is $125 \, \text{cm}^3$.   - **籃球 (Basketball)**: A standard basketball has a diameter of about 24 cm, giving it a radius of 12 cm. Using the volume formula for a sphere, $V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$, the volume is approximately $7238 \, \text{cm}^3$.   - **玩具火車 (Toy Train)**: The volume of a toy train can vary greatly, but a typical small toy train might have a volume around $500 \, \text{cm}^3$.  - Comparing these volumes:   - Marble: $4.19 \, \text{cm}^3$   - Building Block: $125 \, \text{cm}^3$   - Basketball: $7238 \, \text{cm}^3$   - Toy Train: $500 \, \text{cm}^3$  - The basketball has the largest volume among the listed toys.",46.76542091369629,1,True,"EXPLANATION: The question asks which toy has the largest volume among the given options: a marble, a building block, a basketball, and a toy train. The student's solution correctly calculates the approximate volumes of each toy using appropriate formulas and typical dimensions. The volumes are as follows:  - Marble: $4.19 \, \text{cm}^3$ - Building Block: $125 \, \text{cm}^3$ - Basketball: $7238 \, \text{cm}^3$ - Toy Train: $500 \, \text{cm}^3$  The student correctly identifies that the basketball has the largest volume among the listed toys.  RATIONALITY: CORRECT",True,"EXPLANATION: 1. **Understanding the Question**: The question asks which toy has the largest volume among the given options: a marble, a building block, a basketball, and a toy train.  2. **Analyzing the Student's Solution**:    - The student correctly identifies the need to compare the volumes of the toys.    - The student provides the volume formula for a sphere and applies it to a marble with a radius of 1 cm, calculating the volume as approximately $4.19 \, \text{cm}^3$.    - For the building block, the student assumes a cube with a side length of 5 cm and correctly calculates the volume as $125 \, \text{cm}^3$ using the formula for the volume of a cube.    - The student uses the volume formula for a sphere to calculate the volume of a basketball with a radius of 12 cm, resulting in approximately $7238 \, \text{cm}^3$.    - The student estimates the volume of a toy train to be around $500 \, \text{cm}^3$.  3. **Comparing the Volumes**:    - Marble: $4.19 \, \text{cm}^3$    - Building Block: $125 \, \text{cm}^3$    - Basketball: $7238 \, \text{cm}^3$    - Toy Train: $500 \, \text{cm}^3$  4. **Conclusion**: The student correctly concludes that the basketball has the largest volume among the listed toys.

The student correctly uses the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is \( \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \). The given values are substituted correctly into the formula: \( 15 \, \text{cm} \times 14 \, \text{cm} = 210 \, \text{cm}^2 \). The student correctly identifies the area as 210 square centimeters and selects the correct answer choice (A).  RATIONALITY: CORRECT",True,"EXPLANATION: 1. **Identify the formula for the area of a rectangle:**    - The student correctly identifies the formula for the area of a rectangle as \( \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \).  2. **Substitute the given values into the formula:**    - The student correctly substitutes the given length (15 cm) and width (14 cm) into the formula.  3. **Perform the multiplication:**    - The student performs the multiplication \( 15 \, \text{cm} \times 14 \, \text{cm} \) and arrives at the result \( 210 \, \text{cm}^2 \).  4. **Select the correct answer from the given options:**    - The student selects option (Ａ) 210 平方公分, which matches the calculated area.  Since the student correctly follows all the steps and arrives at the correct answer, their solution is accurate.  GRADE: CORRECT",2834,0.020699999999999996
(   )下列敘述何者正確？　(Ａ)長方形面積＝（長＋寬）×2　　(Ｂ)長方形周長＝長＋寬＋長＋寬　(Ｃ)正方形周長＝邊長×邊長　(Ｄ)正方形面積＝長×寬。,"- **ANSWER**: (Ｂ)長方形周長＝長＋寬＋長＋寬 - **SOLUTION**:   - **Option (Ａ)**: 長方形面積＝（長＋寬）×2     - This is incorrect. The correct formula for the area of a rectangle is $長 \times 寬$.   - **Option (Ｂ)**: 長方形周長＝長＋寬＋長＋寬     - This is correct. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as $2 \times (長 + 寬)$, which simplifies to $長 + 寬 + 長 + 寬$.   - **Option (Ｃ)**: 正方形周長＝邊長×邊長     - This is incorrect. The correct formula for the perimeter of a square is $4 \times 邊長$.   - **Option (Ｄ)**: 正方形面積＝長×寬     - This is incorrect. The correct formula for the area of a square is $邊長 \times 邊長$.",問題: 新問題: (   )下列敘述何者正確？　(Ａ)圓的面積＝直徑×圓周率　　(Ｂ)圓的周長＝2×半徑×圓周率 　(Ｃ)三角形的周長＝三邊長度相加 　(Ｄ)三角形的面積＝底×高。,"- **ANSWER**: (B) and (C) - **SOLUTION**:   - **Statement (A)**: The correct formula for the area of a circle is \( \text{Area} = \pi \times r^2 \), not \( \text{Diameter} \times \pi \). Hence, this statement is incorrect.   - **Statement (B)**: The correct formula for the circumference of a circle is \( \text{Circumference} = 2\pi r \), which matches the given statement.
