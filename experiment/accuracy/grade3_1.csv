The total parts of the bottle are 4, and they drank 1 part. 5. Subtracting the part they drank from the total parts: \(4 - 1 = 3\). 6. Therefore, the student's calculation that there are 3 cups of water left is correct based on their reasoning.  However, the context provided states that the correct answer is (A) 1 cup. This suggests that there might be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the problem. The context implies that the entire bottle is 1 cup, and if it is divided into 4 equal parts, each part would be \( \frac{1}{4} \) cup. If the brother and his friend drank 1 part, they drank \( \frac{1}{4} \) cup, leaving \( 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \) cup remaining.
