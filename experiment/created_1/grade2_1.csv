(   )按照數的順序數數看，140－□－120－110，　□　中的數是多少？　(Ａ)　139　(Ｂ)　135　(Ｃ)　130。,"-90 is not one of the options provided. Let's re-evaluate the problem.  The sequence is 140 - □ - 120 - 110. We need to find the number that fits in the blank (□) such that the sequence makes sense.  Let's break it down step-by-step:  1. Start with 140. 2. Subtract the number in the blank (□). 3. The result should be 120. 4. Subtract 120 from the result. 5. The final result should be 110.  So, the equation should be: $$ 140 - □ = 120 $$ $$ □ = 140 - 120 $$ $$ □ = 20 $$  But 20 is not one of the options either. Let's consider the sequence in a different way:  - The sequence should be decreasing in a logical manner. - The difference between 140 and 120 is 20. - The difference between 120 and 110 is 10.  So, the number in the blank should be such that it maintains a logical decreasing sequence.
