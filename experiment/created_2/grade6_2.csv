The student's solution correctly calculates the boat's speed in still water as 20 km/h. However, the calculation for the river's flow speed is incorrect. The correct river flow speed should be calculated as follows:  - Given the downstream speed is 33 km/h and the boat's speed in still water is 20 km/h:   - \( 33 \text{ km/h} = 20 \text{ km/h} + v \)   - \( v = 33 \text{ km/h} - 20 \text{ km/h} = 13 \text{ km/h} \)  The student's solution correctly identifies that the boat's speed in still water is 20 km/h, but incorrectly calculates the river's flow speed as 13 km/h instead of the correct value.
