This implies that the number of dogs and cats cannot be the same because it leads to a contradiction. The student's solution correctly identifies this contradiction and analyzes each option based on the given conditions.   - For option (A), if there are 10 dogs, then there should be 10 cats, leading to an equal number of legs, which contradicts the condition. - For option (B), if there are 10 cats, then there should be 10 dogs, leading to an equal number of legs, which contradicts the condition. - For option (C), if there are 20 cats and dogs in total, then there should be 10 dogs and 10 cats, leading to an equal number of legs, which contradicts the condition. - For option (D), if there are 40 cat legs, then there should be 10 cats, leading to 10 dogs, and an equal number of legs, which contradicts the condition.
