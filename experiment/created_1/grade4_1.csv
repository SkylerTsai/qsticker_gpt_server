EXPLANATION: The question asks for the maximum number of hours allowed for parking in a typical parking fee system. The student's answer and solution consider common practices in parking systems, which often have a 24-hour limit to ensure availability for other users. The reasoning is logical and aligns with common parking policies.  RATIONALITY: CORRECT",True,"EXPLANATION: 1. **Understand the context of the question:** The student correctly identifies that the question is about determining the maximum number of hours allowed for parking. 2. **Evaluate the options:** The student lists the given options: 72 hours, 24 hours, 12 hours, 6 hours. 3. **Consider typical parking systems:** The student notes that most parking systems have a maximum limit to ensure availability, which is a reasonable consideration. 4. **Compare the options with common practices:** The student compares the options and notes that 24 hours is a common maximum limit in many parking systems. 5. **Deduce the most logical answer:** The student concludes that 24 hours is the most reasonable choice based on the comparison with common practices.  The student's reasoning is logical and follows a clear thought process. They correctly identify the context, evaluate the options, and make a reasonable deduction based on common practices.

(   )「5400÷270」和哪個算式的商一樣？　(Ａ)　54÷27　(Ｂ)　540÷270　(Ｃ)　540÷27　(Ｄ)　5400÷27。,"- **ANSWER**: (Ｃ) 540 ÷ 27 - **SOLUTION**:   - Calculate the quotient of $5400 ÷ 270$:     - $5400 ÷ 270 = 20$   - Compare with the given options:     - $54 ÷ 27 = 2$     - $540 ÷ 270 = 2$     - $540 ÷ 27 = 20$     - $5400 ÷ 27 = 200$   - The quotient of $540 ÷ 27$ is $20$, which matches the quotient of $5400 ÷ 270$. Therefore, the correct answer is (Ｃ) 540 ÷ 27.",問題: (   )「7200 ÷ 300」和哪個算式的商一樣？　(Ａ)　72 ÷ 30　(Ｂ)　720 ÷ 300　(Ｃ)　720 ÷ 30　(Ｄ)　7200 ÷ 30。,"- **ANSWER:** (Ｃ) 720 ÷ 30 - **SOLUTION:**   - Calculate the quotient of $$7200 \div 300$$:     - $$7200 \div 300 = 24$$   - Compare with the given options:     - (Ａ) $$72 \div 30 = 2.4$$     - (Ｂ) $$720 \div 300 = 2.4$$     - (Ｃ) $$720 \div 30 = 24$$     - (Ｄ) $$7200 \div 30 = 240$$   - The quotient of $$7200 \div 300$$ is the same as $$720 \div 30$$, which is 24.",33.531426668167114,1,True,"EXPLANATION: The question asks which of the given options has the same quotient as \(7200 \div 300\). The student's solution correctly calculates the quotient of \(7200 \div 300\) as 24. The student then compares this result with the quotients of the given options:  - (Ａ) \(72 \div 30 = 2.4\) - (Ｂ) \(720 \div 300 = 2.4\) - (Ｃ) \(720 \div 30 = 24\) - (Ｄ) \(7200 \div 30 = 240\)  The student correctly identifies that the quotient of \(7200 \div 300\) (which is 24) matches the quotient of \(720 \div 30\) (which is also 24). Therefore, the student's answer and solution are rational and correct.  RATIONALITY: CORRECT",True,EXPLANATION: 1. **Identify the original problem:** The question asks which of the given options has the same quotient as \(7200 \div 300\). 2. **Calculate the quotient of the original problem:**     - \(7200 \div 300 = 24\) 3. **Evaluate each option to find their quotients:**    - (Ａ) \(72 \div 30 = 2.4\)    - (Ｂ) \(720 \div 300 = 2.4\)    - (Ｃ) \(720 \div 30 = 24\)    - (Ｄ) \(7200 \div 30 = 240\) 4. **Compare the quotients:**     - The quotient of \(7200 \div 300\) is 24.    - The quotient of option (Ｃ) \(720 \div 30\) is also 24. 5. **Conclusion:** The student's answer and solution correctly identify that the quotient of \(7200 \div 300\) is the same as the quotient of \(720 \div 30\).
