(   )已知　B－5.8＝12.5，利用等量公理可算出　B＝？　(Ａ)　5.8　(Ｂ)　6.7　(Ｃ)　12.5　(Ｄ)　18.3。,"- **ANSWER**: 18.3 - **SOLUTION**:   - Given the equation: $B - 5.8 = 12.5$   - To solve for $B$, add $5.8$ to both sides of the equation:     $$     B - 5.8 + 5.8 = 12.5 + 5.8     $$   - Simplifying the right-hand side:     $$     B = 18.3     $$   - Therefore, the value of $B$ is $18.3$.",問題: (   )已知　C－4.3＝8.9，利用等量公理可算出　C＝？　(Ａ)　4.3　(Ｂ)　8.9　(Ｃ)　13.2　(Ｄ)　13.0。,"- **ANSWER**: (Ｃ) 13.2 - **SOLUTION**:   - Given equation: $$C - 4.3 = 8.9$$   - To solve for \( C \), add 4.3 to both sides of the equation:     $$C = 8.9 + 4.3$$   - Simplify the right-hand side:     $$C = 13.2$$   - Therefore, the value of \( C \) is 13.2.",14.112414598464966,1,True,"EXPLANATION: The question asks for the value of \( C \) given the equation \( C - 4.3 = 8.9 \). The student's solution correctly adds 4.3 to both sides of the equation to isolate \( C \), resulting in \( C = 13.2 \). The arithmetic is correct, and the answer is a rational number.  RATIONALITY: CORRECT",True,"EXPLANATION: 1. **Given Equation**: The student correctly identifies the given equation as \( C - 4.3 = 8.9 \). 2. **Isolating \( C \)**: The student correctly states that to solve for \( C \), you need to add 4.3 to both sides of the equation. This is a correct application of the addition property of equality. 3. **Performing the Addition**: The student correctly performs the addition on the right-hand side of the equation: \( 8.9 + 4.3 \). 4. **Simplifying**: The student correctly simplifies the right-hand side to get \( C = 13.2 \). 5. **Conclusion**: The student concludes that the value of \( C \) is 13.2, which matches the correct answer choice (Ｃ) 13.2.

The value of π is a mathematical constant (approximately 3.14159) and does not change regardless of the size of the circle. Therefore, the value of π is the same for all circles, making the correct answer (Ｄ)一樣大 (all the same).  RATIONALITY: CORRECT",True,"EXPLANATION: 1. **Understanding the Question**: The question asks which circle (X, Y, or Z) has the largest value of \(\pi\) (pi), given their circumferences. 2. **Formula for Circumference**: The student correctly identifies that the circumference \( C \) of a circle is given by the formula \( C = 2\pi r \). 3. **Proportionality**: The student correctly notes that the circumference \( C \) is directly proportional to the radius \( r \), meaning that as the radius changes, the circumference changes proportionally. 4. **Constant Value of \(\pi\)**: The student correctly concludes that the value of \(\pi\) is a constant and does not change regardless of the size of the circle. 5. **Conclusion**: Based on the above reasoning, the student correctly concludes that the value of \(\pi\) is the same for all circles X, Y, and Z.
