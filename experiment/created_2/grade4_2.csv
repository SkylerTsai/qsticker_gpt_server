Therefore, 小華 bought 2064 oranges in total.",18.651244401931763,1,True,"EXPLANATION: The question asks for the total number of oranges 小華 bought if one bag contains 86 oranges, 8 bags make up one box, and 小華 bought 3 boxes. The solution provided correctly calculates the number of oranges in one box and then multiplies that by the number of boxes to find the total number of oranges. The calculations are as follows:  1. Number of oranges in one box:    \( 86 \text{ oranges/bag} \times 8 \text{ bags/box} = 688 \text{ oranges/box} \)  2. Total number of oranges in 3 boxes:    \( 688 \text{ oranges/box} \times 3 \text{ boxes} = 2064 \text{ oranges} \)  The answer provided is 2064 oranges, which matches the calculations. Therefore, the solution is rational and correct.  RATIONALITY: CORRECT",True,"EXPLANATION: 1. The problem states that one bag contains 86 oranges and 8 bags make up one box. The student correctly calculates the number of oranges in one box:    \[    86 \text{ oranges/bag} \times 8 \text{ bags/box} = 688 \text{ oranges/box}    \]    This step is correct.  2. Next, the student calculates the total number of oranges in 3 boxes:    \[    688 \text{ oranges/box} \times 3 \text{ boxes} = 2064 \text{ oranges}    \]    This step is also correct.  3. The student concludes that 小華 bought 2064 oranges in total, which matches the calculation.  GRADE: CORRECT",2849,0.020905
(   )水壺的容量是　2　公升，已知水壺裡有　250　毫升的水，還要倒入多少的水才能把水壺裝滿？　(Ａ)　1　公升　75　毫升　(Ｂ)　1　公升　750　毫升　(Ｃ)　1075　毫升　(Ｄ)　17500　毫升。,"- **ANSWER**: (Ｂ) 1 公升 750 毫升 - **SOLUTION**:   - The total capacity of the water bottle is 2 liters, which is equivalent to 2000 milliliters.   - The current amount of water in the bottle is 250 milliliters.   - To find out how much more water is needed to fill the bottle, subtract the current amount from the total capacity:     $$ 2000 \, \text{ml} - 250 \, \text{ml} = 1750 \, \text{ml} $$   - Convert 1750 milliliters to liters and milliliters:     $$ 1750 \, \text{ml} = 1 \, \text{liter} \, 750 \, \text{ml} $$   - Therefore, the answer is (Ｂ) 1 公升 750 毫升.",問題：新問題：一個背包的容量是 5 升，已知背包裡有 1200 毫升的水，還要倒入多少的水才能把背包裝滿？ (Ａ) 3 公升 1800 毫升 (Ｂ) 3 公升 800 毫升 (Ｃ) 3800 毫升 (Ｄ) 31800 毫升。,"- **ANSWER**: (Ｃ) 3800 毫升 - **SOLUTION**:   - Convert the backpack's capacity to milliliters: $5 \text{ liters} = 5000 \text{ milliliters}$   - Subtract the amount of water already in the backpack from the total capacity: $5000 \text{ milliliters} - 1200 \text{ milliliters} = 3800 \text{ milliliters}$   - Therefore, the amount of water needed to fill the backpack is $3800 \text{ milliliters}$.",19.165433883666992,1,True,"EXPLANATION: The question asks how much more water is needed to fill a backpack with a capacity of 5 liters, given that it already contains 1200 milliliters of water. The solution correctly converts the backpack's capacity from liters to milliliters (5 liters = 5000 milliliters). It then correctly subtracts the amount of water already in the backpack (1200 milliliters) from the total capacity (5000 milliliters), resulting in 3800 milliliters. The answer provided is (Ｃ) 3800 毫升, which matches the calculated amount.  RATIONALITY: CORRECT",True,"EXPLANATION: 1. **Convert the backpack's capacity to milliliters**:    - The backpack's capacity is given as 5 liters.    - 1 liter is equivalent to 1000 milliliters.    - Therefore, $5 \text{ liters} = 5 \times 1000 \text{ milliliters} = 5000 \text{ milliliters}$.    - The student correctly converts 5 liters to 5000 milliliters.  2. **Subtract the amount of water already in the backpack from the total capacity**:    - The backpack already contains 1200 milliliters of water.    - To find out how much more water is needed to fill the backpack, subtract the current amount of water from the total capacity.    - $5000 \text{ milliliters} - 1200 \text{ milliliters} = 3800 \text{ milliliters}$.    - The student correctly performs the subtraction to find the remaining capacity.  3. **Conclusion**:    - The student concludes that the amount of water needed to fill the backpack is 3800 milliliters.    - This matches the correct answer choice (Ｃ) 3800 毫升.
