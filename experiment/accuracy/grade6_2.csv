EXPLANATION:  1. The problem asks which equation is incorrect for finding the height of a rectangular prism with a volume of 7.2 cubic meters, a length of 4 meters, and a width of 2.25 meters. 2. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is \( V = l \times w \times h \). 3. To find the height \( h \), we rearrange the formula to \( h = \frac{V}{l \times w} \). 4. Given \( V = 7.2 \), \( l = 4 \), and \( w = 2.25 \), we substitute these values into the formula: \( h = \frac{7.2}{4 \times 2.25} \). 5. Simplifying, \( h = \frac{7.2}{9} = 0.8 \) meters. 6. We now evaluate each option to see if it correctly calculates the height:    - (Ａ) \( 7.2 ÷ (4 \times 2.25) = 7.2 ÷ 9 = 0.8 \) (correct)    - (Ｂ) \( 7.2 ÷ 4 ÷ 2.25 = 1.8 ÷ 2.25 = 0.8 \) (correct)    - (Ｃ) \( 7.2 ÷ (4 + 2.25) = 7.2 ÷ 6.25 = 1.152 \) (incorrect)    - (Ｄ) \( 7.2 ÷ 2.25 ÷ 4 = 3.2 ÷ 4 = 0.8 \) (correct) 7. The student correctly identified that option (Ｃ) is incorrect because it uses addition instead of multiplication in the denominator, leading to an incorrect height calculation.

**SOLUTION**:   - Calculate the time taken to walk 24 km at 6 km/h:     $$ \text{Time} = \frac{24 \text{ km}}{6 \text{ km/h}} = 4 \text{ hours} $$   - Determine the number of 45-minute walking intervals in 4 hours:     $$ \text{Number of intervals} = \frac{4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour}}{45 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{240}{45} = 5.33 \approx 5 \text{ intervals} $$   - Calculate the total rest time:     $$ \text{Total rest time} = 5 \text{ intervals} \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 75 \text{ minutes} = 1 \text{ hour} 15 \text{ minutes} $$   - Add the walking time and rest time:     $$ \text{Total time} = 4 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} 15 \text{ minutes} = 5 \text{ hours} 15 \text{ minutes} $$   - Correct the number of intervals to 4 (since the last interval does not require rest):     $$ \text{Corrected total rest time} = 4 \text{ intervals} \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} = 1 \text{ hour} $$   -

The context provides the correct answer and a brief explanation: (B) 55 candies. The explanation shows the steps: 23 × 2 = 46, and 101 - 46 = 55. 3. The student's answer is (B) 55 candies, which matches the correct answer provided in the context. 4. The student's solution involves setting up an equation to solve for the number of candies the sister originally had:    - Let the number of candies the sister originally had be \( x \).    - After 小敏 gives 23 candies to her sister, 小敏 will have \( 101 - 23 \) candies left.    - The sister will then have \( x + 23 \) candies.    - According to the problem, the number of candies both have will be equal: \( 101 - 23 = x + 23 \).    - Simplify the equation: \( 78 = x + 23 \).    - Solve for \( x \): \( x = 78 - 23 \), \( x = 55 \). 5. The student's solution correctly follows the logical steps to arrive at the answer 55 candies, which is consistent with the context.  GRADE: CORRECT",2992,0.02319

Substitute \( m = 2s \) into \( m - s = 24 \):      - \( 2s - s = 24 \)      - \( s = 24 \)   4. Substitute \( s = 24 \) back into \( m = 2s \):      - \( m = 2 \times 24 = 48 \)   5. 10 years later, the mother's age will be \( 48 + 10 = 58 \) and the sister's age will be \( 24 + 10 = 34 \).   6.

This matches the context provided, which states that the age difference is fixed. Therefore, the student's answer is factually accurate.",True,"EXPLANATION: 1. The question asks for the age difference between the mother and the sister 10 years later. 2. The context provides the correct answer as (C) 24 years, with the explanation that the age difference remains constant over time. 3. The student's answer is (C) 24 years, and they provide a detailed solution to support their answer. 4. The student's solution correctly sets up the equations based on the given information:    - \( m = 2s \) (mother's age is twice the sister's age)    - \( m - s = 24 \) (the age difference is 24 years) 5. The student correctly substitutes \( m = 2s \) into \( m - s = 24 \) to find \( s = 24 \). 6. The student then correctly calculates the mother's age as \( m = 48 \). 7. The student correctly calculates the ages 10 years later: mother will be 58 and sister will be 34. 8. The student correctly concludes that the age difference remains 24 years, as \( 58 - 34 = 24 \).
