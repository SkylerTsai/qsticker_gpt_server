(   )姐姐將　1　公尺的緞帶，每　1　公分剪成　1　小段，共剪成　100　小段，1　小段的緞帶是幾公尺？　(Ａ)　0.01　公尺　(Ｂ)　0.1　公尺　(Ｃ)　1　公尺　(Ｄ)　0.10　公尺。,"- **ANSWER:** (Ａ) 0.01 公尺 - **SOLUTION:**   - The total length of the ribbon is 1 meter.   - The ribbon is cut into 100 small segments.   - To find the length of one small segment, divide the total length by the number of segments:     $$ \frac{1 \text{ meter}}{100} = 0.01 \text{ meter} $$   - Therefore, each small segment is 0.01 meters long.",問題: (   )弟弟將 2 公尺的彩帶，每 2 公分剪成 1 小段，共剪成 100 小段，1 小段的彩帶是幾公尺？ (Ａ) 0.02 公尺 (Ｂ) 0.2 公尺 (Ｃ) 0.01 公尺 (Ｄ) 0.1 公尺。,"- **ANSWER:** (Ａ) 0.02 公尺 - **SOLUTION:**   - The total length of the ribbon is 2 meters.   - The ribbon is cut into 100 pieces.   - To find the length of each piece, divide the total length by the number of pieces:     $$ \frac{2 \text{ meters}}{100} = 0.02 \text{ meters} $$   - Therefore, each piece of ribbon is 0.02 meters long.",18.518929719924927,1,True,"EXPLANATION: The question asks for the length of each piece of ribbon when a 2-meter ribbon is cut into 100 pieces, with each piece being 2 centimeters long. The student's solution correctly calculates the length of each piece by dividing the total length of the ribbon (2 meters) by the number of pieces (100). The calculation is accurate and the units are correctly converted and used.  RATIONALITY: CORRECT",True,"EXPLANATION: 1. **Understanding the Problem:**    - The total length of the ribbon is 2 meters.    - The ribbon is cut into pieces, each 2 centimeters long.    - We need to determine the length of each piece in meters.  2. **Conversion of Units:**    - 2 centimeters is equivalent to 0.02 meters (since 1 meter = 100 centimeters).  3. **Calculation of Number of Pieces:**    - The student states that the ribbon is cut into 100 pieces.     - To verify, we calculate the number of pieces:       $$ \frac{2 \text{ meters}}{0.02 \text{ meters per piece}} = 100 \text{ pieces} $$    - This confirms that the ribbon is indeed cut into 100 pieces.  4. **Finding the Length of Each Piece:**    - The student correctly divides the total length by the number of pieces:      $$ \frac{2 \text{ meters}}{100 \text{ pieces}} = 0.02 \text{ meters per piece} $$  5. **Conclusion:**    - The student's calculation and reasoning are correct.    - The length of each piece is indeed 0.02 meters.

(   )「62153　公尺＝（　）公里（　）公尺」，（　）中依順要填入什麼？　(Ａ)　6，2153　(Ｂ)　62，153　(Ｃ)　621，53　(Ｄ)　6215，3。,"- **ANSWER**: (Ｂ) 62，153 - **SOLUTION**:   - To convert meters to kilometers, divide the number of meters by 1000.   - Calculation: $62153 \div 1000 = 62.153$   - This means 62153 meters is equal to 62 kilometers and 153 meters.   - Therefore, the correct option is (Ｂ) 62，153.",問題: (   )「73429 公克＝（ ）公斤（ ）公克」，（ ）中依順要填入什麼？ (Ａ) 73，429 (Ｂ) 734，29 (Ｃ) 7342，9 (Ｄ) 73，429。,"- **ANSWER**: (Ａ) 73，429 - **SOLUTION**:   - To convert grams to kilograms, divide the number of grams by 1000.   - Calculation: $$73429 \, \text{grams} \div 1000 = 73.429 \, \text{kilograms}$$   - This means 73429 grams is equal to 73 kilograms and 429 grams.   - Therefore, the correct option is (Ａ) 73，429.",16.586737155914307,1,True,EXPLANATION: The question asks to fill in the blanks to convert 73429 grams into kilograms and grams. The correct approach is to divide the number of grams by 1000 to get the kilograms and the remainder will be the grams.   - 73429 grams divided by 1000 equals 73.429 kilograms. - This means 73429 grams is equal to 73 kilograms and 429 grams.  The student's answer and solution correctly follow this method and arrive at the correct conversion.  RATIONALITY: CORRECT,True,"EXPLANATION: 1. **Understanding the Question**: The question asks to fill in the blanks for the conversion of 73429 grams to kilograms and grams. The options provided are different ways to split the number 73429 into kilograms and grams.  2. **Conversion Process**:    - To convert grams to kilograms, we divide the number of grams by 1000.    - Performing the division: \( 73429 \, \text{grams} \div 1000 = 73.429 \, \text{kilograms} \).  3. **Interpreting the Result**:    - The result \( 73.429 \, \text{kilograms} \) can be broken down into 73 kilograms and 0.429 kilograms.    - Since 1 kilogram = 1000 grams, \( 0.429 \, \text{kilograms} \) is equivalent to \( 0.429 \times 1000 = 429 \, \text{grams} \).  4. **Matching with Options**:    - The breakdown of 73429 grams is 73 kilograms and 429 grams.    - The correct option that matches this breakdown is (Ａ) 73，429.  5. **Verification**:    - The student's solution correctly follows the steps of converting grams to kilograms and then interpreting the decimal part as grams.    - The student correctly identifies the option that matches the conversion result.
