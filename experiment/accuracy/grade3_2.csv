The student's answer is 80, and their solution involves calculating 8 × 10 = 80 and then adding a remainder. 4. The student correctly identifies that the remainder must be added to 80, but they incorrectly conclude that 80 itself is a possible value. 5. Since the remainder is not 0, 80 cannot be a correct answer because it would imply a remainder of 0. 6. Therefore, the student's answer does not match the possible values provided in the context.
