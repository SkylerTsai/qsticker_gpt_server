The correct conversion is 1 liter = 1000 cubic centimeters, so 2880 cubic centimeters is actually 2.88 liters, not 2880 liters. Therefore, the correct answer is (Ｄ) 2.88 公升.",False,"EXPLANATION: 1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves calculating the volume of oil added to a rectangular tank, which caused the water level to rise from 17 cm to 20 cm. The dimensions of the tank are given as 40 cm (length), 24 cm (width), and the change in water depth is 3 cm (20 cm - 17 cm).  2. **Calculating the Volume of Oil Added**:    - The base area of the tank is calculated as:      \[      \text{Base Area} = 40 \, \text{cm} \times 24 \, \text{cm} = 960 \, \text{cm}^2      \]    - The change in water depth is:      \[      \text{Change in Depth} = 20 \, \text{cm} - 17 \, \text{cm} = 3 \, \text{cm}      \]    - The volume of oil added is:      \[      \text{Volume of Oil} = \text{Base Area} \times \text{Change in Depth} = 960 \, \text{cm}^2 \times 3 \, \text{cm} = 2880 \, \text{cm}^3      \]  3. **Converting Cubic Centimeters to Liters**:    - Since 1 liter = 1000 cubic centimeters, the volume in liters is:      \[      \text{Volume in Liters} = \frac{2880 \, \text{cm}^3}{1000} = 2.88 \, \text{liters}      \]  4. **Evaluating the Student's Answer**:    - The student correctly calculated the volume of oil added in cubic centimeters (2880 cm³).    - However, the student incorrectly converted cubic centimeters to liters, stating that 2880 cm³ equals 2880 liters, which is incorrect. The correct conversion should be 2.88 liters.  5. **Conclusion**:    - The student's final answer of 2880 liters is factually incorrect based on the correct conversion from cubic centimeters to liters.
