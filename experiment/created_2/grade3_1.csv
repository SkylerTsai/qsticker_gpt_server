The student has provided a solution that involves checking the remainder of each number when divided by 5. 3. Let's verify each step taken by the student:     - For (Ａ) 13: The student states $13 \div 5 = 2$ remainder $3$. This is correct because $13 = 5 \times 2 + 3$.    - For (Ｂ) 25: The student states $25 \div 5 = 5$ remainder $0$. This is correct because $25 = 5 \times 5 + 0$.    - For (Ｃ) 31: The student states $31 \div 5 = 6$ remainder $1$. This is correct because $31 = 5 \times 6 + 1$.    - For (Ｄ) 47: The student states $47 \div 5 = 9$ remainder $2$. This is correct because $47 = 5 \times 9 + 2$.  4. The student concludes that 25 is the only number that gives a remainder of 0 when divided by 5. 5. The student's answer and solution are consistent and correctly identify (Ｂ) 25 as the number that can be divided by 5 without a remainder.  GRADE: CORRECT,3643,0.026244999999999997
