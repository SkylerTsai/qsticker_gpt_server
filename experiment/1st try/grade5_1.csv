The student's answer matches the context's correct answer and reasoning. 5. The student correctly identified that 76 is not a multiple of 18 by showing the division results for each option and confirming that 76 ÷ 18 is not an integer.  GRADE: CORRECT",3127,0.022115

The student's answer is (D) 14, with a detailed solution provided. 4. Let's break down the student's solution:    - The student starts with the equation \( \frac{x^2}{2} = \frac{7}{y} \).    - They substitute \( x = 2 \) into the equation, resulting in \( \frac{2^2}{2} = \frac{7}{y} \).    - Simplifying, they get \( \frac{4}{2} = \frac{7}{y} \), which simplifies further to \( 2 = \frac{7}{y} \).    - Solving for \( y \), they find \( y = \frac{7}{2} \), which is 3.5.    - The student then incorrectly concludes that \( y = 14 \) when \( x = 2 \), which is a mistake. 5. The correct approach, as per the context, is to recognize that \( 7 ÷ 2 = 3.5 \) and \( 2 × 3.5 = 7 \), leading to the correct answer being 7. 6.
