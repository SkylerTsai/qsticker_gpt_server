The solution correctly analyzes different cases for the integer \( x \) (positive, zero, and negative) and shows that the product can be greater than, equal to, or less than the original integer depending on the value of \( x \). Therefore, the answer (D) ""not necessarily"" is correct. RATIONALITY: CORRECT",True,"EXPLANATION: 1. **Understanding the Question:**    - The question asks about the result of multiplying an integer by another integer greater than 1. The options are whether the product will be (A) greater, (B) the same, (C) smaller, or (D) not necessarily any of these.  2. **Analyzing the Student's Solution:**    - The student correctly identifies the multiplicand as \( x \) and the multiplier as \( y \), with \( y > 1 \).    - The student then considers three cases for \( x \):      - **Case 1:** \( x > 0 \) (positive integer)        - The student states that \( x \times y \) will be greater than \( x \). This is correct because multiplying a positive integer by a number greater than 1 results in a larger number.        - Example provided: \( x = 2 \) and \( y = 3 \), resulting in \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \), which is greater than 2.      - **Case 2:** \( x = 0 \) (zero)        - The student states that any number multiplied by zero is zero. This is correct.        - Example provided: \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 3 \), resulting in \( 0 \times 3 = 0 \), which is the same as 0.      - **Case 3:** \( x < 0 \) (negative integer)        - The student states that \( x \times y \) will be less than \( x \). This is correct because multiplying a negative integer by a number greater than 1 results in a more negative number.        - Example provided: \( x = -2 \) and \( y = 3 \), resulting in \( -2 \times 3 = -6 \), which is less than -2.  3. **Conclusion:**    - The student concludes that the product \( x \times y \) can be greater than, the same as, or smaller than the multiplicand \( x \) depending on the value of \( x \).    - This conclusion aligns with the correct answer (D) not necessarily, as the product's relationship to the multiplicand varies based on whether \( x \) is positive, zero, or negative.
