For example, 8 and 15 are coprime but neither is a prime number. This statement is incorrect.   - **Option (Ｃ)**: The GCD of 13 and 91 is 13, which means they are not coprime.

This matches the provided context.,True,"EXPLANATION: 1. **Option (Ａ)**: The student states that if two numbers are coprime, their least common multiple (LCM) is the product of the two numbers. This is correct because the definition of coprime numbers is that their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1, and the LCM of two numbers is given by the formula LCM(a, b) = (a * b) / GCD(a, b). When GCD(a, b) = 1, LCM(a, b) = a * b.     2. **Option (Ｂ)**: The student correctly identifies that two coprime numbers do not have to be prime. For example, 8 and 15 are coprime but neither is a prime number. This matches the context provided, which states that coprime numbers do not necessarily have to be prime.  3. **Option (Ｃ)**: The student correctly points out that 13 and 91 are not coprime because their GCD is 13. This is consistent with the context, which states that 13 and 91 have a common prime factor of 13.  4. **Option (Ｄ)**: The student incorrectly states that two prime numbers are not necessarily coprime. The context clearly states that two prime numbers are always coprime because their only common divisor is 1. Therefore, the student's statement here is incorrect.  The student's answer correctly identifies (Ａ) as the correct option and provides accurate explanations for why the other options are incorrect, except for a minor error in the explanation of option (Ｄ).

The question asks for the number of integer values of \( a \) such that \( \frac{a}{60} \) is in its simplest form and lies between \( \frac{7}{12} \) and \( \frac{13}{15} \). 2. First, we need to convert the given fractions to have a common denominator of 60:    - \( \frac{13}{15} = \frac{13 \times 4}{15 \times 4} = \frac{52}{60} \)    - \( \frac{7}{12} = \frac{7 \times 5}{12 \times 5} = \frac{35}{60} \) 3.

EXPLANATION: 1. The question asks which of the given options has the same result as \( \frac{20}{3} \div \frac{14}{9} \). 2. The context provides the correct answer and the steps to solve the expression: \( \frac{20}{3} \div \frac{14}{9} = \frac{20}{3} \times \frac{9}{14} = \frac{20 \times 9}{3 \times 14} = \frac{180}{42} = \frac{60}{14} \). 3. The student correctly identifies that \( \frac{20}{3} \div \frac{14}{9} \) simplifies to \( \frac{60}{14} \). 4. The student then compares this result with the options provided:    - (Ａ) \( 20 \div 5 = 4.0 \)    - (Ｂ) \( 60 \div 14 = 4.285714285714286 \)    - (Ｃ) \( 20 \div 14 = 1.4285714285714286 \)    - (Ｄ) \( 60 \div 5 = 12.0 \) 5.

The explanation provided by the student is accurate and aligns with the context.",True,"EXPLANATION: 1. The question asks which of the given fractions cannot represent the ratio \( \frac{a}{b} \) if the simplest integer ratio of \( a : b \) is \( 3 : 5 \). 2. From the context, we know that \( \frac{a}{b} = \frac{3}{5} \). 3. We need to check each option to see if it equals \( \frac{3}{5} \):    - Option (A) \( \frac{6}{10} \):      - Simplifying \( \frac{6}{10} \) gives \( \frac{3}{5} \), which matches \( \frac{a}{b} \).    - Option (B) \( \frac{30}{50} \):      - Simplifying \( \frac{30}{50} \) gives \( \frac{3}{5} \), which matches \( \frac{a}{b} \).    - Option (C) \( \frac{39}{65} \):      - Simplifying \( \frac{39}{65} \) gives \( \frac{3}{5} \), which matches \( \frac{a}{b} \).    - Option (D) \( \frac{51}{95} \):      - Simplifying \( \frac{51}{95} \) does not give \( \frac{3}{5} \).
