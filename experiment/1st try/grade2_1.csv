(   )按照數的順序數數看，140－□－120－110，　□　中的數是多少？　(Ａ)　139　(Ｂ)　135　(Ｃ)　130。,答案：(Ｃ) 解析：從　140　往下　10　個一數，是　130。 ,中,1-1_數到200,"-90 is not one of the options provided. Let's re-evaluate the problem.  The sequence is 140 - □ - 120 - 110. We need to find the number that fits in the blank (□) such that the sequence makes sense.  Let's break it down step-by-step:  1. Start with 140. 2. Subtract the number in the blank (□). 3. The result should be 120. 4. Subtract 120 from the result. 5. The final result should be 110.  So, the equation should be: $$ 140 - □ = 120 $$ $$ □ = 140 - 120 $$ $$ □ = 20 $$  But 20 is not one of the options either. Let's consider the sequence in a different way:  - The sequence should be decreasing in a logical manner. - The difference between 140 and 120 is 20. - The difference between 120 and 110 is 10.  So, the number in the blank should be such that it maintains a logical decreasing sequence.  Let's try the options:  - (A) 139: 140 - 139 = 1, which doesn't fit. - (B) 135: 140 - 135 = 5, which doesn't fit. - (C) 130: 140 - 130 = 10, which fits the pattern.

The options are given in terms of how many ""4s"" less it is. 2. **Context Analysis**: The context explains that \(4 \times 4\) means there are 4 groups of 4, and \(4 \times 5\) means there are 5 groups of 4. Since 4 groups are less than 5 groups by 1 group, \(4 \times 4\) is 1 group of 4 less than \(4 \times 5\). 3. **Student's Calculation**:    - The student correctly calculates \(4 \times 4 = 16\).    - The student correctly calculates \(4 \times 5 = 20\).    - The student correctly finds the difference: \(20 - 16 = 4\). 4. **Student's Conclusion**: The student concludes that since the difference is 4, and 4 is \(2 \times 4\), the difference is 2 groups of 4. 5. **Verification**:    - The context states that \(4 \times 4\) is 1 group of 4 less than \(4 \times 5\).    - The student's conclusion that the difference is 2 groups of 4 is incorrect because it misinterprets the context.

It can also move 90 small divisions (30 + 60) to complete one full circle plus an additional half circle. However, moving 60 small divisions would mean the minute hand returns to the 12, which is not possible in the given scenario. 3. **Student's Answer Analysis**: The student states that none of the given options (30, 60, and 90) is not a possible movement for the minute hand. The student provides a detailed explanation involving the total number of small divisions on a clock face and concludes that all given options are possible movements. 4. **Verification**:    - **Option A: 30 small divisions**: The context confirms this is possible.    - **Option B: 60 small divisions**: The context states this is not possible because the minute hand would return to the 12.    - **Option C: 90 small divisions**: The context confirms this is possible. 5. **Conclusion**: The student's answer is incorrect because the context clearly states that 60 small divisions is not a possible movement for the minute hand.
